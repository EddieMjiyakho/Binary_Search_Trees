# CSC2001F 2023 Assignment 1: TokTik Proof-of-Concept

## Instructions

### Overview
The goal of this assignment is to create a simple proof-of-concept replica of some functionalities of a social media system like TikTok, using Binary Search Trees (BST) as the main underlying data structure. The application stores data in memory while performing multiple functions on-demand until the user exits.

### Application Features
Every user has a record with the following data fields:
- `account`
- `profile description`
- `list of posts` (most recent first)

Each post includes:
- `title`
- `name of video clip file`
- `number of likes`

### Required Functionalities
Your application must include the following functionalities:
1. Find the profile description for a given account
2. List all accounts (in any order)
3. Create an account
4. Delete an account
5. Display all posts for a single account (with newest posts first)
6. Add a new post for an account
7. Load a file of actions from disk and process this in sequence (Create and Add actions)
8. Quit

### User Interface
A text menu is required, but you can use a graphical or GUI-based interface.
